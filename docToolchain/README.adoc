==== create awesome docs!

_docToolchain_ is an implementation of the http://www.writethedocs.org/guide/docs-as-code/[_docs-as-code_] approach for software architecture.
The basis of docToolchain is the philosophy that software documentation should be treated in the same way as code together with the http://arc42.org[_arc42_] template for software architecture.
